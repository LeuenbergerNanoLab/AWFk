# AWFk
Plot wave function with phase information.

The program [Acvk.f90](src) reads envelope wave functions generated by Yambo and generates Gnuplot script to plot them.

Intensity of the color is proportional to the absolute value, and the color (blue-red) is proportional to the phase of the wave function.
