# AWFk
Plot wave function with phase information.

The program Acvk.f90 read envelope wave functions generated by Yambo and generate Gnuplot script to plot them.
Intensity of the color is proportional to the absolute value of the wave function, and the color (blue-red) is proportional to the phase.
